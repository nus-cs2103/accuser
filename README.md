# Accuser [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nus-cs2103/accuser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nus-cs2103/accuser)

Accuser is a lightweight framework that lets you write Github bots that monitor issues and pull requests and work with them.

The framework wraps around the [node-github](https://github.com/mikedeboer/node-github) library to make it easier to monitor pull requests, assign people and write comments.
